Ok. So we have an excel sheet that has the data for pretty much every relevant weapon in the game.
The individual sheets by weapon type contain ratings for the specific traits of each weapon (ttk, dmg, etc)
There is one sheet that is specific for just perk data. This one will be used to adjust the rating of a weapon (assuming only increase?)
With given weapon data from the hash constants that we have, we can devlop an algorithm to predict the value of an item.

Given:
1. Weapon's default rating (based on ttk/dmg/etc)
2. The adjusted rating based on the perks the item has
3. Maybe adjust it even more based on rarity? (if this is available) -> maybe on light.gg
